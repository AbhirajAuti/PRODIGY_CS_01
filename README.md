# PRODIGY_CS_01

This my 1st Task Of Internship in CyberSecurity with Prodigy Infotech !!!!

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques 🔒. Named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to communicate securely with his generals 🛡️, this cipher involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet 🔄. For example, with a shift of 3️⃣, A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher and is easy to both implement and break 🧩, especially with small shifts, making it suitable for basic encryption tasks but not for serious security needs 🚫.

Here are Snapshot of output 👇
